# Distanced base sequence logos

This online tool, hosted on Google Colab, is designed to generate sequence logos based on the distance from a target residue or ligand in a given dataset of pdbs. The distance is calculated using the alpha carbon positions between protein interfaces or all non-hydrogen atoms in the case of ligands. The tool also includes a 3D visualizer that plots the entire target structure and highlights the residues within the specified distance constraint. There are two options for coloring the interacting residues based on [Amino colour](http://acces.ens-lyon.fr/biotic/rastop/help/colour.htm#aminocolours) and [Shapely colour](http://acces.ens-lyon.fr/biotic/rastop/help/colour.htm#shapelycolours). 

The sequence logos aim to show sequence diversity in binding interactions with various motifs or structures.
This tool is able to generate sequence logos  and 3d scatter plots from a protein (Figure 1,3) or a ligand (Figure 2,4) target.
