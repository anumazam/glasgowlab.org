I am an assistant professor at Columbia University Medical Center in the [Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics](https://www.biochem.cuimc.columbia.edu/). I grew up on the Jersey Shore. As an undergraduate in the [Gracias Lab](https://graciaslab.johnshopkins.edu/), I built self-folding micro-structures. In graduate school, I studied nature's most beautiful self-folding systems -- proteins -- in the [DTE Lab](https://dtelab.northwestern.edu/) at UC Berkeley. For the last few years, I moved into computational biophysics to design new proteins for artifical functions as a postdoctoral fellow in the [Kortemme Lab](http://kortemmelab.ucsf.edu/) at UCSF. I am so pumped to do protein science in NYC!!

I am a third-year undergraduate student working towards a B.A. in Biochemistry. I was born in Bógota, Colombia, and moved to the US 6 years ago. I lived in Miami, Florida, and obtained my Associate Degree in chemistry at Miami Dade College. There, I worked with Dr. Juan Morata where I became fascinated with viruses and their ability to hack biological mechanisms. Currently, I am learning about protein engineering and computational biology; I am extremely excited to keep studying proteins! Outside the lab, I enjoy reading, playing, and developing videogames, skateboarding, and museums!

I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at Columbia University. I received my B.A. and Ph.D. degree in Chemical Engineering from Tsinghua University. My prior research focused on the conformational dynamics of enzymes and the creation of novel-to-nature protein-metal cluster composites utilizing both computational and experimental methods. To pursue my interests in understanding and designing fantastic molecular machines: proteins, I moved to the Glasgow lab. I am excited to combine MD simulation with HDX mass spectrometry to investigate the allosteric regulation of a critical enzyme in glycolysis.

I am a PhD student in the Integrated Program hailing from California. I obtained my bachelor’s degree from Whitman College, where I studied Environmental Studies and Biology. Most recently, I was a research technician in Dr. Roy Gerona’s lab at UC San Francisco, using mass spectrometry to study forensic toxicology and antibiotic therapy adherence. I am interested in cool proteins and cool science!

I was born and raised in Richardson, TX. I am currently a freshman undergraduate at Columbia University majoring in Biomedical Engineering. I have prior research experience with molecular dynamics simulations and solvation chemistry. I am currently working on PARROTS, a pipeline for rapidly engineering antiviral therapeutics. Outside of research, I love eating strawberries, playing tennis, lifting weights, and taking long walks.

I am a second year PhD candidate in the Integrated Program in Cellular, Molecular, and Biomedical Studies at Columbia University. Before beginning my PhD, I received my B.A. in Biology from NYU and worked as a technician at Columbia’s Chio Laboratory, investigating redox adaptations acquired by Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma cells to survive persistent oxidative stress. At the Glasgow lab, my work is centered on understanding the allosteric regulation of conserved, key glycolytic enzyme PFK-1. A more detailed picture of PFK-1's conformational ensemble will allow for the rational design of new classes of allosteric therapeutics to target this essential enzyme in diseases such as cancer. Additionally, uncovering the differences in allosteric mechanisms between human and pathogenic orthologs of PFK-1 can inform the design of cool new antibiotics.

I am a first year Graduate student in the Integrated Program of Cellular, Molecular, and Biomedical Studies at Columbia. I will soon join the Glasgow lab after rotations. I received my bachelor’s degree from the University of Florida in Biotechnology as well as a minor in Bioinformatics. My previous research focused on mitigating the effects of citrus greening, a bacterial pathogenic infection, in citrus plants. I specialized in RNA-Seq experiments, genome assemblies, and isoform discovery to uncover mechanisms of resistance. My current interests are in metabolic engineering and synthetic biology. I wish to create novel enzymes and transcription factors for the use in synthetic systems.

I am a second-year PhD student in physics at Columbia. I did my undergrad also in physics at Columbia, and before starting here I did research in condensed matter physics and genomics labs. I am excited about protein biophysics and currently studying allostery using HDX mass spectrometry.
